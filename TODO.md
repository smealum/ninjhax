This is a (probably non-exhaustive) list of what remains to be done on the exploit codebase before release :

 - ~~support CN_JPN~~
 - improve spider cleanup stability (filtered spray)
 - ~~support spider v2050~~
 - ~~support pre-5.0 FIRM~~
 - ~~support spider v3074/v3075/v3088~~
 - support multiple version simultaneously
 - cleanup cn_qr_initial_payload
 - write proper cn_save_initial_payload
 - "boot.3dsx not found" screen
 - "couldn't retrieve HTTP payload" thing
 - savedata uninstaller
 - return to hbmenu (LR)
 - allocate more memory to CN + clear it before jumping to menu
